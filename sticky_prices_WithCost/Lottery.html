    <b style="font-size:140%;"> Loss Aversion Question </b>
        <p>
            This is the last page of the experiment.
            You will make one final decision.
            Based on the outcome, additional money may be added to your final payment.
            There are 5 options presented on this screen.
            Each option has a 50% chance of adding money to your final payment and an equal chance of losing money.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you would like to participate in this final opportunity to change your payment, you can select “Yes” for as many options as you would like to try.
            Only one of these 5 rows will be implemented.
            The computer will randomly select one lottery to be played.
            Then, if you said “Yes” to that row, the computer will flip a coin (virtually) to randomly decide whether you gain $4 or lose money according to the amount listed for that option.
            Select “Yes” for as many options as you would like to have the opportunity of playing.
            On the following screen, you will learn the outcome of your decision.
        </p>
